Final Analysis:
---
As rental income growth increases, the trend in sale prices decreases. When the trend in sale prices increases, rental income growth decreases; however, this trend is not true for all the neighborhoods across San Francisco. Westwood Park had the highest gross rent. Union Square District had the highest sale price per square foot.

Reviewing the plots, northern San Francisco seems to be the best area to pursue the potential one-click, buy-and rent strategy. The region is primarily associated with cheaper rent and lower sale price per square foot.

The most interesting properties are Lake --The Presidio, Hunters Point, Mission Bay and South Beach, located along the coast. These might be properties that could garner some interest. They all have low gross rent (under $2600) and are reasonable within the sale price per square foot (500/sqft).
